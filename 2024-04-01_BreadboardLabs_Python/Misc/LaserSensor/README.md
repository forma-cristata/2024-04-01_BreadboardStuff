## Overview

The KY-008 Laser Transmitter module is a commonly used component in Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects for emitting a small laser beam. Paired with the Laser Receiver module, it enables the detection of this emitted laser beam. This combination is widely used in various DIY projects, including robotics, security systems, and interactive installations.

This repository provides basic information about the KY-008 Laser Transmitter + Laser Receiver module, including pinout, sample code, and external documentation.

## Pinout

The KY-008 module typically has three pins:

- **S** (Signal): Connects to a digital pin on the Arduino for sending control signals.
- **+** (Power): Connects to the 5V pin on the Arduino for supplying power.
- **-** (Ground): Connects to the GND pin on the Arduino for grounding.
